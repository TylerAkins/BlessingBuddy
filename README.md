# BlessingBuddy

One-click buffs and rescue heals for players and pets **outside your group** in World of Warcraft: Forever.

Target a friendly stranger and BlessingBuddy shows a small bar with your single-target buffs, a recommended buff for the target's class, the target's health and a row of rescue heals.

## Download
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/blessingbuddy)
- [GitHub Releases](../../releases)

## Features
- Recommended buff by target class, skips buffs the target already has
- Paladin one-blessing rule aware (refreshes instead of overwriting)
- Rescue row: heals, shields, dispels + target health bar
- Heal prediction on the health bar: incoming heals, remaining healing of running HoTs, and a preview when you hover a heal button – overhealing is cut off at 100 %
- Paladin: your own blessing shows as done (greyed out) and turns into a refresh button with countdown when it has less than 5 minutes left
- Buff ranks match the target's level (no "target too low" errors)
- Pets of other players: health bar, heals, Thorns
- Works in combat, keybinds, range/cooldown display, PvP warning
- Always casts your highest learned rank
- Optional visibility for players outside your group, party members, raid members, and yourself (Interface > AddOns > BlessingBuddy; defaults keep the classic “strangers only” behavior outside combat; self off by default)
- English and German interface

Supported classes: Paladin, Druid, Priest, Mage, Warlock, Shaman.
